# Python Docstring Guidelines

In Python, it is essential for each module, function, and class to have a docstring. Docstrings provide a convenient way of associating documentation with Python code.

## PEP 257 â€“ Docstring Conventions

PEP 257 outlines the conventions for writing docstrings in Python. Adhering to these conventions ensures consistency and clarity in your code documentation.

## Google Python Style Guide

[Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) provides a comprehensive set of rules and examples for writing clear and concise docstrings.

## Streamlining the Process with LLMs

Writing docstrings can be a tedious and time-consuming task. However, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) can simplify this process.

### Using LLMCode

[LLMCode](https://github.com/javierganan99/LLMCode) can assist in generating initial versions of docstrings, making the documentation process more efficient. Also, AI code Editors like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) can help you write docstrings.
